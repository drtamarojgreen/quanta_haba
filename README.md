QuantaHaba 🌱

QuantaHaba is a Velo-integrated, LLM-powered design editor that transforms the way creators build interactive web experiences. It’s not just another website editor — it’s a safe, structured habitat for ideas to grow.

Think: Figma meets Wix Velo meets ChatGPT, but with the Quanta ecosystem’s brain-inspired touch.

✨ Features

LLM-Driven Design Suggestions
Natural language → styled components. Describe what you want, and QuantaHaba scaffolds it in code + layout.

Velo Integration
Extend Wix sites with Velo custom logic, plugins, and APIs directly inside the editor.

Structured Creativity (the Haba concept)
QuantaHaba is built around “design habitats” — safe spaces for experimenting with CSS, HTML, and Velo code blocks without breaking production.

Interactive Component Library
Pre-built micro-apps (quizzes, journals, community tools) that can be slotted in instantly.

AI Pair Designer
Guided design flow that suggests accessibility fixes, performance optimizations, and modern UI patterns.

## Developer Tools

In addition to the main QuantaHaba web editor, the project includes a suite of tools for C++ and Python developers.

### Haba C++ CLI Tool

The `haba-converter` is a command-line utility for converting `.haba` files into standard `.html` files.

**Usage:**
```bash
./haba-converter /path/to/your/file.haba
```

### C++/Python Editor Enhancements

The project also defines a collection of C++ and Python editor enhancements, designed to be implemented without third-party libraries.

**Key C/C++ Features:**
- Header/Source file switching
- Include autocompletion
- Basic code formatting and build error parsing
- GDB debugger integration

**Key Python Features:**
- Virtual environment detection
- Import autocompletion and sorting
- PEP 8 style linting
- Jupyter-like cell execution with PDB debugger integration

🧠 Philosophy

QuantaHaba is inspired by growth environments — just like a greenhouse helps plants bloom, a design habitat nurtures creativity without chaos.
It brings structure to exploration, combining:

Cognitive systems thinking (from Quanta_Tissu)

Practical front-end development (Velo + web tech)

AI-assisted design flows (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot synergy)

🔮 Future Ideas

“Bloom Mode” → generate a full theme + typography palette from a single word.

“Haba Quests” → guided learning flows for new designers.

Plugin Marketplace → share and remix QuantaHaba creations.

⚡ Quick Start

Coming soon... once Gemini finishes bootstrapping the codebase.
