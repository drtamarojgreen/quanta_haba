# TISSLM Integration Summary

This document summarizes the work completed to integrate the "Quanta Haba" demo into the existing editor application. The implementation evolved significantly based on changing requirements.

## 1. Initial Goal

The primary objective was to create a demo application to showcase the capabilities of the `quanta_tissu` language model. The demo required a three-panel layout (Prompt Editor, Dashboard, Console) to visualize the model processing a list of tasks from a file.

## 2. Evolution of Requirements

The project went through several major iterations:

1.  **Initial API-based Approach**: The first implementation integrated the demo directly into the main editor window, replacing the existing functionality. It was designed to use a REST API for model interactions.

2.  **Shift to Additive Integration**: The requirements changed to ensure no existing editor functionality was removed. The implementation was completely reworked to be additive. A "Quanta Demo" button was added to the main editor's toolbar, which launches the demo in a separate `Toplevel` window. This preserved the original editor and its features.

3.  **Shift from REST API to Python Package**: The final major change was to the integration method. The requirement to use a REST API was replaced with instructions to use the `quanta_tissu` Python package directly.

## 3. Final Implementation Details

The final submitted version of the integration includes the following features:

### Code and Functionality

-   **Non-Destructive UI**: A **"Quanta Demo" button** was added to the main editor's toolbar in `src/p/editor.py`.
-   **Separate Demo Window**: The demo runs in a self-contained `Toplevel` window (`QuantaDemoWindow` class) to keep its logic separate from the main editor.
-   **Python Package Integration**: The demo now imports `QuantaTissu`, `Tokenizer`, and `generate_text` from the `quanta_tissu` package.
-   **Model Initialization**: On launch, the demo window attempts to initialize the tokenizer and model using placeholder paths (`/path/to/your/tokenizer`, `/path/to/your/model_checkpoint.npz`).
-   **Robust Error Handling**: The implementation gracefully handles `ImportError` if the `quanta_tissu` package is not installed and `FileNotFoundError` if the model/tokenizer artifacts are not found. In these cases, the application logs an error to the console and proceeds using stubbed responses, ensuring the demo remains functional.
-   **Automated Workflow**: The demo automatically loads `src/p/default_prompt.txt` and processes each `TODO:` task sequentially, updating the UI panels in real-time.

### File Structure

The following files were created or modified to support this feature:

-   **`src/p/editor.py` (Modified)**:
    -   Added the `QuantaDemoWindow(tk.Toplevel)` class containing the full demo UI and logic.
    -   Added a "Quanta Demo" button to the `HabaEditor` class to launch the new window.
    -   Added necessary imports for `numpy` and `quanta_tissu`.

-   **`src/p/requirements.txt` (Created)**:

-   **`src/p/default_prompt.txt` (Created)**:
