# Process for Integrating External Models via OAuth

This document outlines a standardized process for selecting and integrating external, third-party language models into the `quanta_haba` demonstration application. The focus is on ensuring security, stability, and a seamless integration experience.

## 1. Model Selection Framework

Before integration, any potential external model must be evaluated against a set of key criteria.

#### a. Functionality and Performance
- **Capability Match**: Does the model provide the specific text generation, summarization, or other capabilities required by our use cases?
- **Performance Metrics**: What are the model's average latency, throughput, and accuracy? Is it performant enough for an interactive desktop application?
- **Sandbox/Trial Access**: Is there a free tier or sandbox environment available for evaluation and development?

#### b. API Quality and Documentation
- **API Standard**: Does the API adhere to common standards (e.g., REST, JSON-RPC)? A clean, predictable API is crucial.
- **Documentation**: Is the API documentation clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date? Does it include practical examples?
- **SDK/Client Libraries**: Does the provider offer official or community-supported client libraries for Python?

#### c. Authentication and Security
- **Authentication Method**: What mechanism is used for authentication? Strong preference is given to models that support the **OAuth 2.0 protocol**.
- **OAuth 2.0 Support**: This is the preferred method as it allows the application to access the API on behalf of a user without handling their credentials directly. It provides secure, delegated access.
- **API Key Fallback**: If OAuth is not available, the use of simple API keys is a less secure alternative and requires robust measures for key storage and rotation.

#### d. Cost and Quotas
- **Pricing Model**: Is the cost based on tokens, per-call, or a subscription? Is the pricing transparent and predictable?
- **Rate Limiting**: What are the API rate limits and usage quotas? Are they sufficient for the demo's expected usage patterns?

#### e. Terms of Service and Licensing
- **Data Privacy**: How is the data sent to the model handled? Does the provider's privacy policy meet our standards?
- **Licensing**: Are the model's terms of use and licensing compatible with the intended use in this project?

## 2. Standard Integration Process (OAuth 2.0 Example)

Once a model is selected, the following process should be followed for integration.

#### Step 1: Application Registration
- Register the `quanta_haba` application with the external model provider's developer portal.
- Obtain the necessary OAuth 2.0 credentials, typically a `Client ID` and a `Client Secret`.
- Configure the allowed `redirect URIs` (callback URLs) for the application. For a desktop app, this might be a `localhost` address.

#### Step 2: Implement the OAuth 2.0 Flow
- **Authorization Request**: When a user wants to connect their account, the application will open a browser window to the provider's authorization URL, passing the `Client ID` and requested scopes.
- **User Consent**: The user logs into their account on the provider's site and grants the application permission.
- **Authorization Code**: The provider redirects the user back to the specified `redirect URI` with a temporary `authorization code`.
- **Token Exchange**: The `quanta_haba` application backend (or a secure local process) sends the `authorization code`, `Client ID`, and `Client Secret` to the provider's token endpoint.
- **Receive Tokens**: The provider returns an `access token` and a `refresh token`.

#### Step 3: Secure Storage and API Calls
- **Token Storage**: The `access token` and `refresh token` must be stored securely. For a desktop application, this means using the operating system's credential manager (e.g., Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain).
- **Making API Calls**: The `access token` is included in the `Authorization` header of every API request to the model.
- **Token Refresh**: The `access token` is short-lived. When it expires, the application must use the long-lived `refresh token` to request a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.

#### Step 4: Build an API Client Wrapper
- Create a dedicated Python class (`e.g., ExternalModelClient`) within `quanta_haba` to encapsulate all interaction with the external API.
- This wrapper should handle:
  - Making API requests with the correct headers.
  - Automatically managing the token refresh logic.
  - Translating API errors into application-specific exceptions.

#### Step 5: Prototyping and Testing
- Develop the integration on a separate feature branch.
- Thoroughly test the entire end-to-end flow, from initial user authorization to successful API calls and token refreshes.
- Validate that all credentials are being stored securely and are never exposed in logs or plain text files.
