# C & Python Editor Enhancements

This document outlines approximately 50 editor enhancements targeted at C/C++ and Python development. These can be implemented without requiring users to install additional third-party libraries or frameworks, relying on built-in editor capabilities and standard language tools.

---

### A. General Editor Features (C & Python)

**1. Advanced Syntax Highlighting**
- **Challenge:** Distinguishing between variable types, function declarations, and regular variable usage requires more than simple regex.
- **Mitigation:** Implement a lightweight lexical analyzer (tokenizer) that runs on file content. Maintain a simple symbol table for the current file to track variable declarations vs. usage, enabling more contextual highlighting.

**2. Code Folding for Blocks**
- **Challenge:** Reliably identifying the start and end of foldable regions (functions, classes, loops) in the face of syntax errors or inconsistent formatting.
- **Mitigation:** Use a parser that tracks indentation levels for Python and brace nesting (`{...}`) for C/C++. The editor can then mark lines between a recognized start and end token as a foldable region.

**3. Symbol-based Autocompletion**
- **Challenge:** Parsing the current file and its dependencies (`#include` or `import`) for symbols without slowing down the editor.
- **Mitigation:** On file open or save, trigger an asynchronous background task to parse the file and its direct dependencies. Store the discovered symbols (functions, variables, classes) in a hash map for fast lookups.

**4. Code Snippet System**
- **Challenge:** Providing a user-friendly way to manage and invoke custom snippets.
- **Mitigation:** Store built-in and user-defined snippets in a simple JSON file. The editor can trigger snippet expansion when a user types a keyword and presses Tab, replacing the keyword with the snippet body.

**5. Bracket/Pair Matching**
- **Challenge:** Instantly and accurately finding a matching bracket (`()`, `{}`, `[]`) in a large file.
- **Mitigation:** When the cursor is next to a bracket, scan forwards or backwards from that position. Use a counter that increments for opening brackets and decrements for closing ones; the match is found when the counter hits zero.

**6. Intelligent Comment/Uncomment**
- **Challenge:** Correctly applying line comments vs. block comments to a selection.
- **Mitigation:** The editor checks the language context. For a selection, it adds or removes `//` (C++) or `#` (Python) at the beginning of each line. For C, it can wrap the selection in `/* ... */`.

**7. Auto-indentation**
- **Challenge:** Determining the correct indentation level for a new line based on language-specific rules.
- **Mitigation:** When the user presses Enter, the editor inspects the previous line. If it ends with `{` (C) or `:` (Python), the new line's indentation is increased.

**8. File Symbol Outline**
- **Challenge:** Extracting a structured list of all functions and classes from a file.
- **Mitigation:** Use a regex-based parser that runs on file save to find function and class definition patterns (`def ...:` or `return_type func(...) {`). Display the results as a clickable list in a side panel.

**9. Vertical (Column) Block Selection**
- **Challenge:** Applying edits to multiple lines at once within a rectangular selection.
- **Mitigation:** Internally, represent the selection by its start and end `(line, column)` coordinates. When the user types, the editor iterates through the selected lines and inserts the text at the correct column on each.

**10. File History Navigation**
- **Challenge:** Tracking cursor positions across multiple files to provide "go back" and "go forward" functionality.
- **Mitigation:** Maintain a stack of `(filepath, line, column)` location tuples. A new location is pushed onto the stack after a significant jump (e.g., opening a new file, clicking in the symbol outline).

---

### B. C/C++ Language Features

**11. Header/Source File Switching**
- **Challenge:** Finding the corresponding `.h` or `.cpp` file if it's not in the same directory.
- **Mitigation:** Implement a simple heuristic: first check for the file in the same directory. If not found, search in user-configured "source" and "include" directories.

**12. Include Autocompletion**
- **Challenge:** Providing a list of standard library and project-specific headers.
- **Mitigation:** Maintain a hardcoded list of standard headers (`<stdio.h>`, `<vector>`, etc.). For project headers, scan the configured include paths for `.h` and `.hpp` files.

**13. Macro Expansion Preview**
- **Challenge:** Accurately expanding a complex C macro requires a full preprocessor.
- **Mitigation:** Implement a basic preprocessor that can handle simple, non-recursive `#define` substitutions. On hover, it can show the expanded text for these simple cases.

**14. `#include` Error Checking**
- **Challenge:** Verifying that an included file exists in the project's include paths.
- **Mitigation:** On save, parse all `#include "..."` and `#include <...>` directives. For each, search the configured include paths. If the file is not found, add a highlight to the line.

**15. `printf` Format String Checker**
- **Challenge:** Validating format specifiers against argument types is a compiler-level task.
- **Mitigation:** Use regex to approximate. Count the number of `%` format specifiers in a `printf` format string and compare it to the number of arguments provided. This catches argument count mismatches.

**16. `struct`/`class` Member Autocompletion**
- **Challenge:** Requires knowing a variable's type and finding its definition.
- **Mitigation:** Enhance the symbol table to store variable types. When the user types `.` or `->`, look up the variable's type, find the `struct`/`class` definition, and parse its body for member names.

**17. `NULL` Pointer Dereference Hinting**
- **Challenge:** This is a classic hard problem in static analysis.
- **Mitigation:** Implement a trivial check. If a pointer is explicitly compared to `NULL` and then immediately dereferenced in the next statement without reassignment, flag it as a potential issue.

**18. Include Guard Helper**
- **Challenge:** Generating a unique and conventional name for an include guard.
- **Mitigation:** When a new header file is created, automatically insert an include guard. The guard name can be generated from the filename, converted to uppercase (e.g., `MY_HEADER_H`).

**19. Basic Code Formatting**
- **Challenge:** Building a full code beautifier is complex.
- **Mitigation:** Focus on a few key rules. Implement a tokenizer that can enforce consistent indentation (spaces vs. tabs) and brace style (e.g., ensuring `{` is on a new line).

**20. Show Type on Hover**
- **Challenge:** Requires an accurate symbol table with type information.
- **Mitigation:** Use the same symbol table built for member autocompletion. On hover, identify the symbol under the cursor and display its stored type information in a tooltip.

---

### C. Python Language Features

**21. Virtual Environment Display**
- **Challenge:** Reliably detecting the active Python virtual environment.
- **Mitigation:** On startup, check for the `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable. If it's set, display its basename in the editor's status bar to inform the user.

**22. Import Autocompletion**
- **Challenge:** Finding all available standard library and third-party modules.
- **Mitigation:** Use a configurable Python interpreter to inspect its `sys.path`. Scan these paths for importable modules and cache the list for quick autocompletion suggestions.

**23. Basic PEP 8 Style Linting**
- **Challenge:** Implementing the full PEP 8 style guide is a large task.
- **Mitigation:** Implement a few high-impact, easy-to-check rules. For example, check line length (> 79 characters) and ensure indentation is a multiple of 4 spaces.

**24. Docstring Generation Stub**
- **Challenge:** Parsing a function's signature to include its arguments in the docstring.
- **Mitigation:** When a user types `"""` after a `def` line, use regex to parse the function name and arguments. Insert a docstring stub with placeholders for a summary, each argument, and the return value.

**25. "Run in Terminal" Command**
- **Challenge:** Managing an external terminal process.
- **Mitigation:** Provide a command that opens a new terminal window (or uses a built-in one) and executes the current script using a configured Python interpreter (e.g., `python /path/to/script.py`).

**26. Magic Comment Checker**
- **Challenge:** Enforcing the correct placement of encoding declarations.
- **Mitigation:** On file save, check if a line matching the pattern `# -*- coding: ... -*-` exists. If it does, and it's not on line 1 or 2, highlight it as a style warning.

**27. Import Sorting Helper**
- **Challenge:** Correctly categorizing imports into standard library, third-party, and local groups.
- **Mitigation:** Maintain a list of Python's standard library modules. When triggered, parse the block of import statements, group them, sort each group alphabetically, and rewrite the block.

**28. f-string Conversion Helper**
- **Challenge:** Safely rewriting older string formatting styles.
- **Mitigation:** Use regex to find simple cases of `"...".format(var)` or `"%s" % var`. A tool can then offer to convert these simple patterns into f-strings.

**29. Decorator Syntax Highlighting**
- **Challenge:** Differentiating decorators from other syntax.
- **Mitigation:** This is a simple rule for the syntax highlighter. Any line that begins with an `@` symbol followed by a valid identifier can be given a distinct style.

**30. Jupyter-like Cell Execution**
- **Challenge:** Running blocks of code interactively requires a persistent Python kernel.
- **Mitigation:** Maintain a single background Python process running in interactive mode. Use comments like `# %%` to denote cell boundaries. When the user "runs" a cell, send the code to the process's stdin and display the output.

---

### D. Build & Debugging Features

**31. Configurable Build Command**
- **Challenge:** Providing a flexible way for users to define their build process.
- **Mitigation:** Allow the user to configure a single build command (e.g., `make` or `gcc -o myapp main.c`) in a project settings file. A button in the UI simply executes this command.

**32. Build Error Parsing**
- **Challenge:** Compiler error formats differ between GCC, Clang, and other compilers.
- **Mitigation:** Use a set of configurable regex patterns to parse errors from build output. A default pattern like `filename:line:column: error: message` will catch most common formats. Parsed errors can be listed in a clickable panel.

**33. Breakpoint Gutter**
- **Challenge:** Visually managing breakpoints and communicating them to a debugger.
- **Mitigation:** Allow users to click in the editor's gutter to toggle breakpoints. The editor maintains a list of `(filepath, line)` tuples that can be sent to a debugger when a session starts.

**34. Basic Debugger Integration (GDB/PDB)**
- **Challenge:** Communicating with a command-line debugger is complex.
- **Mitigation:** Start the debugger (GDB for C/C++, PDB for Python) as a child process. Use its machine interface (GDB/MI) or standard commands to send actions like "step over" or "continue" and parse the resulting output.

**35. Variable Watch Window**
- **Challenge:** Requesting and displaying variable values from a debugger.
- **Mitigation:** When the debugger is paused, send the appropriate command (`info locals` in GDB, `p locals()` in PDB) to the debugger process. Parse the text output and display it in a simple UI panel.

**36. Call Stack Display**
- **Challenge:** Getting and displaying the current call stack.
- **Mitigation:** When paused, send the "backtrace" command (`bt` for GDB, `where` for PDB) to the debugger. Parse the formatted text output and display it as a clickable list that allows navigating up and down the stack.

**37. Launch Configuration File**
- **Challenge:** Managing different run, build, and debug configurations.
- **Mitigation:** Define a simple JSON file format (e.g., `.editor/launch.json`) where users can specify commands for building, running, and debugging their project. The editor reads this file to populate its UI actions.

**38. Automatic Rebuild on Save**
- **Challenge:** Preventing excessive rebuilds if the user saves frequently.
- **Mitigation:** Use a debounce mechanism. After a file is saved, wait for a short, configurable delay (e.g., 500ms). If another save occurs during that time, reset the timer. If not, trigger the build command.

**39. Conditional Breakpoints**
- **Challenge:** Passing a condition from the UI to the debugger.
- **Mitigation:** Allow a user to right-click a breakpoint to add a condition (a string). This string is then passed to the debugger as part of the breakpoint command (e.g., `break main.c:42 if x > 10`).

**40. Run Without Debugging Command**
- **Challenge:** Knowing what executable to run.
- **Mitigation:** The user can specify a `runCommand` in the project's launch configuration file. This command is executed directly without attaching a debugger.

---

### E. Quality & Analysis Features

**41. Cyclomatic Complexity Hinting**
- **Challenge:** A true cyclomatic complexity calculation requires a full control-flow graph.
- **Mitigation:** Use an approximation. For each function, count the number of branching keywords (`if`, `for`, `while`, `case`, `&&`, `||`) and add 1. Display this number as a hint.

**42. Trailing Whitespace Highlighter**
- **Challenge:** Avoiding performance issues on very large files.
- **Mitigation:** Use a simple regex (`\s+$`) to find trailing whitespace. To optimize, only run the check on lines that are currently visible in the editor's viewport, or run it on the entire file on save.

**43. TODO/FIXME Comment Explorer**
- **Challenge:** Quickly scanning an entire project for comments can be slow.
- **Mitigation:** Use a background process that leverages a fast text search tool (like `grep` or a native equivalent) to find all `TODO:` and `FIXME:` comments. Cache the results and display them in a side panel.

**44. Unused Variable Highlighting**
- **Challenge:** This requires scope analysis and tracking variable usage.
- **Mitigation:** Implement a simple version that works within a single function scope. Parse the function to find all declared variables. Then, scan the function again to see if they are ever read. If not, highlight the declaration.

**45. Inconsistent Indentation Detector**
- **Challenge:** A simple but important style check.
- **Mitigation:** On file load or save, scan the leading whitespace of every line. If lines indented with tabs and lines indented with spaces are both found, display a warning in the status bar.

**46. Check for `goto` usage in C**
- **Challenge:** Discouraging a controversial language feature.
- **Mitigation:** Add a simple linting rule that flags any use of the `goto` keyword as a style warning, which can be configured by the user.

**47. Python `__name__ == "__main__"` Guard Hint**
- **Challenge:** Heuristically detecting when this guard is needed.
- **Mitigation:** If a Python file contains function or class definitions but also has executable code at the top-level indentation, suggest wrapping that code in an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

**48. C Header Include Order Linting**
- **Challenge:** Enforcing a consistent include order.
- **Mitigation:** Implement a configurable linting rule. For example, enforce that system headers (`<..._>`) must be listed before project headers (`"..."`), and that groups should be sorted alphabetically.

**49. Spell Checker for Comments & Strings**
- **Challenge:** Requires a dictionary and efficient checking.
- **Mitigation:** Use a built-in system dictionary file (e.g., `/usr/share/dict/words`). On save, extract text from comments and string literals, split it into words, and check each against a hash set of dictionary words.

**50. File Statistics Display**
- **Challenge:** Keeping stats updated in real-time can be expensive.
- **Mitigation:** Calculate file statistics (line count, word count) on file load and on save. Display the information in the status bar. Avoid recalculating on every keystroke.
