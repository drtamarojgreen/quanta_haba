# Velo/Wix Integration Enhancements for JavaScript Development

This document outlines proposed features to advance JavaScript editing and debugging capabilities for developers working on the Wix platform, specifically with Velo. These enhancements aim to provide a more robust, efficient, and professional development environment. We will use the `greenhousementalhealth.org` website as a case study to illustrate the practical benefits of these features.

## 1. Advanced JavaScript Editing

To empower developers, the editor should move beyond basic text editing and incorporate intelligent, context-aware features.

### 1.1. Velo-Aware IntelliSense

Provide intelligent code completion that is fully aware of the Velo APIs and the new Wix JavaScript SDK.

*   **API Completion:** Suggest and auto-complete Velo functions, objects, and properties (e.g., `$w`, `wix-data`, `wix-http-functions`).
*   **Element ID Awareness:** The editor should parse the site's structure and provide auto-completion for element IDs. For example, on `greenhousementalhealth.org`, if a developer types `$w('#`, the editor should suggest IDs of existing elements like `#contactForm`, `#gallery1`, or `#textBlock5`.
*   **Event Handler Snippets:** Automatically generate boilerplate for event handlers. For instance, right-clicking an element in the editor could provide an option to "Add onClick handler," which would generate `export function button1_click(event) { ... }` in the page's code.

### 1.2. Real-time Linting and Static Analysis

Integrate a powerful linter like ESLint, configured with rules specific to the Velo environment.

*   **Error Highlighting:** Instantly flag syntax errors, undefined variables, and incorrect Velo API usage.
*   **Best Practice Suggestions:** Provide warnings for common Velo pitfalls, such as making database calls from client-side code that should be in backend web modules.
*   **Performance Tips:** Analyze code for potential performance issues, like inefficient queries or excessive DOM manipulation. For `greenhousementalhealth.org`, it could suggest optimizing image loading or lazy-loading sections below the fold.

## 2. Live Site Debugging Integration

Debugging is a critical part of development. The following features would bridge the gap between the editor and the live, running website.

### 2.1. Integrated Live Console

A console within the editor that mirrors the browser's developer console for the live site.

*   **Log Streaming:** All `console.log()` statements from the site's Velo code should appear in this integrated console in real-time.
*   **Command Execution:** Allow developers to execute JavaScript commands in the context of the live site directly from the editor's console.

### 2.2. Visual Breakpoint and DOM Inspection

Allow developers to debug by interacting visually with the live site.

*   **Set Breakpoints from Editor:** Developers should be able to click on a line number in their Velo code (e.g., in a function handling a form submission) to set a breakpoint. When that code executes on the live site, the debugger would pause, allowing the developer to inspect variables.
*   **Live DOM Inspector:** A tool that lets developers hover over elements on the live preview of `greenhousementalhealth.org`. The tool would highlight the element and show its properties, and allow developers to jump directly to the Velo code that interacts with that element. For example, clicking the "Log In" button could take the developer to its `onClick` handler.

### 2.3. Backend and Web Module Debugging

Extend debugging capabilities to backend code, which is crucial for full-stack development on Wix.

*   **Simulate HTTP Requests:** Provide a tool to test `wix-http-functions` by sending mock `GET`, `POST`, etc., requests directly from the editor and viewing the response, without needing an external tool like Postman.
*   **Database Sandbox:** For `greenhousementalhealth.org`, a developer might want to add a feature for booking appointments, which requires a database. A debugging sandbox would allow them to test database interactions (`wix-data`) with a test copy of the database, preventing accidental changes to live patient data.
