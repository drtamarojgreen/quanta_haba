# Remaining Editor Enhancements & Implementation Strategy

This document outlines the remaining, more complex enhancements from the original feature list. Implementing these features would require significant architectural changes, new UI paradigms, and potentially the integration of third-party libraries.

---

### 1. Advanced IntelliSense (Syntax Highlighting, Autocompletion)

**Associated Features:**
- #1. Advanced Syntax Highlighting
- #3. Symbol-based Autocompletion
- #22. Import Autocompletion

**High-Level Plan:**
The current regex-based approach for text analysis is insufficient for these features. A full language parser is required.

1.  **Integrate a Parsing Engine:**
    -   **Option A (Lightweight):** Build a more sophisticated, stateful tokenizer/parser within the editor for both Python and C++.
    -   **Option B (External Library):** Integrate a well-established parsing library like `jedi` or `parso` for Python. This would provide robust parsing, type inference, and autocompletion suggestions out-of-the-box.
2.  **Project-Wide Symbol Table:** Develop a service that runs in the background to parse all files in the project and maintain a comprehensive symbol table. This table would store information on variables, functions, classes, their scopes, and their types.
3.  **UI for Autocompletion:**
    -   Design and implement a new UI component: a popup/popover listbox that appears at the cursor's position.
    -   This component would be populated with suggestions from the parsing engine and symbol table.
    -   It would need to handle keyboard navigation (up/down arrows, Enter to accept) and mouse clicks.
4.  **Refactor Highlighting:** Rework the existing highlighting logic to use the accurate token information provided by the new parser instead of individual regular expressions.

### 2. Code Folding

**Associated Feature:**
- #2. Code Folding for Blocks

**High-Level Plan:**
This feature is also dependent on a language parser to identify logical code blocks.

1.  **Parser Integration:** Leverage the same parsing engine from the IntelliSense feature to identify the start and end lines of foldable regions (functions, classes, loops, multi-line comments).
2.  **Gutter UI Component:**
    -   Create a new "gutter" widget to the left of the main text editor area. This is a common feature in IDEs.
    -   Implement logic to draw folding markers (`[+]` or `[-]`) in the gutter next to the starting line of each foldable block.
3.  **Folding/Unfolding Logic:**
    -   Implement the core functionality to hide and show ranges of lines in the `tkinter.Text` widget. This requires careful management of text widget tags and possibly the `elide` tag property.
    -   The click events on the gutter icons would trigger this logic.

### 3. Debugger Integration

**Associated Features:**
- #34. Basic Debugger Integration (GDB/PDB)
- #35. Variable Watch Window
- #36. Call Stack Display

**High-Level Plan:**
This is a major feature that requires complex inter-process communication.

1.  **Debugger Process Management:**
    -   Implement logic using Python's `subprocess` module to start GDB (for C/C++) or PDB (for Python) as a child process. The process must be started with pipes for `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` to allow for communication.
2.  **Debugger Interface Protocol:**
    -   For GDB, implement a parser and command formatter for the GDB/MI (Machine Interface), which provides structured key/value-based communication.
    -   For PDB, communication would be via its standard command-line interface, sending commands and parsing the text output.
3.  **New UI Panels for Debugging:**
    -   **Debug Controls:** A new toolbar or panel with buttons for "Continue", "Step Over", "Step In", "Step Out", and "Stop".
    -   **Variable Watch Window:** A tree-view or listbox panel to display local variables. This would be populated by parsing the output of `info locals` (GDB) or `p locals()` (PDB) when the debugger is paused.
    -   **Call Stack Display:** A listbox to display the current call stack, populated by parsing the output of `backtrace` (GDB) or `where` (PDB).
4.  **Breakpoint Integration:** Enhance the existing breakpoint logic (which is currently just a visual concept) to send the appropriate `break` commands to the debugger process when a debugging session starts.

### 4. Other Complex Features

-   **#9. Vertical (Column) Block Selection:** Requires subclassing the `tk.Text` widget to completely override its default selection behavior and drawing logic to handle rectangular selections.
-   **#10. File History Navigation:** Requires a persistent stack to store cursor locations (`(filepath, line, column)`) and hooking into more UI events (file open, tab switch, Go to Definition) to manage the history.
-   **#49. Spell Checker for Comments & Strings:** Requires integrating a dictionary, running checks on a background thread to avoid UI freezes, and implementing a new right-click context menu UI to show spelling suggestions. This is a significant UI addition.
