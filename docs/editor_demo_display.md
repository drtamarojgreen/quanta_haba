# Editor Demo Display Issues and Solutions

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Layout Problems
- **Issue**: The three-panel layout is not displaying correctly
- **Expected**: Left panel (prompt), Right panel (model responses), Bottom panel (console)
- **Current**: Layout may not be properly proportioned or visible

### 2. Prompt File Loading Issues
- **Issue**: Default prompt file may not be loading automatically on demo start
- **Expected**: `src/p/default_prompt.txt` should load immediately when demo opens
- **Current**: File exists but may not be displaying in the left panel

### 3. Model Response Display Issues
- **Issue**: Right panel may not be showing model responses correctly
- **Expected**: Clear display of task → response mappings
- **Current**: Panel may be empty or not properly labeled

### 4. Console Logging Issues
- **Issue**: Bottom panel console may not be displaying logs
- **Expected**: Real-time logging of all processing steps
- **Current**: Console may be empty or not updating

## Root Cause Analysis

### Tkinter Layout Issues
1. **PanedWindow Configuration**: May not be properly configured for three-panel layout
2. **Widget Sizing**: Panels may not have proper minimum sizes or stretch settings
3. **Widget Creation Order**: Widgets may not be created in the correct order
4. **Event Timing**: Auto-loading may happen before widgets are fully initialized

### File Path Issues
1. **Relative Path Problems**: Path resolution may fail in different execution contexts
2. **File Access Timing**: File may be accessed before widgets are ready
3. **Error Handling**: File loading errors may not be properly displayed

### Widget State Issues
1. **Text Widget States**: Widgets may be in wrong state (disabled when should be normal)
2. **Update Timing**: Widget updates may happen before widgets are visible
3. **Focus Issues**: Widgets may not have proper focus or visibility

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Fix Layout Structure
- Use explicit sizing for panels
- Ensure proper widget hierarchy
- Add minimum size constraints
- Test panel visibility and proportions

### 2. Fix Prompt Loading
- Add debug logging for file loading
- Ensure widgets are ready before loading
- Add visual confirmation of loading
- Handle file loading errors gracefully

### 3. Fix Model Response Display
- Ensure right panel is properly initialized
- Add clear labeling and formatting
- Test response display functionality
- Add visual feedback for responses

### 4. Fix Console Logging
- Ensure console widget is properly configured
- Test logging functionality independently
- Add timestamps and clear formatting
- Ensure console updates are visible

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Debug Current State
1. Add comprehensive logging to identify where failures occur
2. Test each panel independently
3. Verify widget creation and initialization
4. Check file loading process

### Phase 2: Fix Layout Issues
1. Restructure PanedWindow configuration
2. Add explicit sizing and constraints
3. Test panel visibility and proportions
4. Ensure proper widget hierarchy

### Phase 3: Fix Functionality Issues
1. Fix prompt file loading with proper timing
2. Ensure model responses display correctly
3. Fix console logging functionality
4. Add proper error handling and feedback

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. Test complete workflow end-to-end
2. Verify all panels display correctly
3. Confirm auto-loading works
4. Validate console logging

## Expected Final Result

### Left Panel (Prompt Editor)
- Displays loaded `default_prompt.txt` content immediately
- Shows TODO tasks clearly
- Highlights current task being processed
- Updates TODO → DONE in real-time

### Right Panel (Model Responses)
- Shows clear list of completed tasks
- Displays task → response mappings
- Uses status icons (✓/⚠) for visual feedback
- Updates in real-time as tasks complete

### Bottom Panel (Console Log)
- Shows detailed processing logs
- Updates in real-time with timestamps
- Displays model initialization status
- Shows all prompt/response interactions
