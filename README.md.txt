QuantaHaba 🌱

QuantaHaba is a Velo-integrated, LLM-powered design editor that transforms the way creators build interactive web experiences. It’s not just another website editor — it’s a safe, structured habitat for ideas to grow.

Think: Figma meets Wix Velo meets ChatGPT, but with the Quanta ecosystem’s brain-inspired touch.

✨ Features

LLM-Driven Design Suggestions
Natural language → styled components. Describe what you want, and QuantaHaba scaffolds it in code + layout.

Velo Integration
Extend Wix sites with Velo custom logic, plugins, and APIs directly inside the editor.

Structured Creativity (the Haba concept)
QuantaHaba is built around “design habitats” — safe spaces for experimenting with CSS, HTML, and Velo code blocks without breaking production.

Interactive Component Library
Pre-built micro-apps (quizzes, journals, community tools) that can be slotted in instantly.

AI Pair Designer
Guided design flow that suggests accessibility fixes, performance optimizations, and modern UI patterns.

🧠 Philosophy

QuantaHaba is inspired by growth environments — just like a greenhouse helps plants bloom, a design habitat nurtures creativity without chaos.
It brings structure to exploration, combining:

Cognitive systems thinking (from Quanta_Tissu)

Practical front-end development (Velo + web tech)

AI-assisted design flows (ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot synergy)

🔮 Future Ideas

“Bloom Mode” → generate a full theme + typography palette from a single word.

“Haba Quests” → guided learning flows for new designers.

Plugin Marketplace → share and remix QuantaHaba creations.

⚡ Quick Start

Coming soon... once Gemini finishes bootstrapping the codebase.
